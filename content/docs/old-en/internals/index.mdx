This section is for developers who want to **contribute to Zvec** or explore its **internal architecture and implementation details**.

If you're using **Zvec as an end user** — inserting vectors, running queries, or managing a vector database instance — please refer to the [User Guide](../guide/) instead. It covers configuration, APIs, and operations without requiring any knowledge of the source code.
