The Zvec `db` is the top-level interface for **managing global configuration** and **creating or opening [collections](../collections/)**.  
All interactions with Zvec begin here.

## Global Configuration

Before performing any database operations, you can optionally configure global settings using the `init()` function.

- If omitted, Zvec automatically applies sensible defaults — typically tuned to your system's available memory, CPU, and environment.
- Use `init()` when you need to customize settings, such as
  - Limiting memory usage
  - Adjusting log verbosity or output format
  - Controlling concurrency (e.g., query thread count)

```python title="Global configuration"
from centaurdb import db

db.init(memory_limit_mb=512, log_type="console", log_level="WARN", query_threads=4)
```

<Callout className="text-base" type="info">
  Call `init()` once, and only at application startup — before any collections are created or opened. It is not intended for runtime reconfiguration.
</Callout>

## Working with Collections

Zvec offers two straightforward functions to manage collections, depending on whether you're starting fresh or loading existing data:

| Function | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| `create_and_open(path, schema, option)` | Creates a new collection from scratch using the provided schema. <br /> ➜ [Learn how to define a schema](../collections/create/) |
| `open(path, option)` | Opens an existing collection stored at the given path. <br /> ➜ [Learn how to load persisted data](../collections/open/) |

<Callout className="text-base" type="success">
  Collections are **self-contained** and portable — each lives in its own directory and can be moved or backed up independently.
</Callout>
