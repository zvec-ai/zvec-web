Zvec provides a complete set of **data manipulation operations** to manage [documents](../concepts/data-modeling/#documents) in your [collection](../collections/).

| Operation | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- |
| [`Insert`](./insert/) | Add new documents (fails if the document `ID` already exists) |
| [`Upsert`](./upsert/) | Insert new documents or replace existing ones by `ID` |
| [`Update`](./update/) | Modify specific fields of existing documents by `ID` |
| [`Delete`](./delete/) | Delete documents by `ID` or using a scalar filter condition |
| [`Query`](./query/) | Perform vector similarity search, optionally combined with scalar filtering and re-ranking |
| [`Fetch`](./fetch/) | Retrieve full documents directly by `ID` |

<Callout className="text-base" type="success">
  All write operations (`insert`, `upsert`, `update`, `delete`) are immediately visible for querying — enabling true real-time, streaming workloads.
</Callout>
