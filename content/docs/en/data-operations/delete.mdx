import { Accordion, Accordions } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/accordion';

Zvec provides two ways to delete [documents](../../concepts/data-modeling/#documents). Choose the method that best fits your use case:

| Method | Input | When to Use |
| ------ | ----- | ----------- |
| `delete()` | One or more document `id`s | Use when you know the exact ID(s) of the documents you want to delete |
| `delete_by_filter()` | A filter expression (e.g., `publish_year < 1900`) | Use for bulk deletion based on field values — ideal for cleaning up documents that match specific criteria |

<Callout className="text-base" type="warn">
  Delete operations are **immediate** and **irreversible**.  
  Always double-check your input before running a delete operation.
</Callout>

## Delete by IDs

Assume you've already opened a collection and have a `collection` object ready.

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Code Example">

  ```python title="Open a collection"
  import zvec

  collection = zvec.open(path="/path/to/example/collection")  # [!code highlight]
  ```

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

Use `delete()` to remove one or more documents when you know their exact IDs.

```python title="Delete documents by IDs"
# Delete a single document
result = collection.delete(ids="doc_id_1")              # [!code highlight]
print(result)  # {"code":0} means success

# Delete multiple documents at once
result = collection.delete(ids=["doc_id_2", "doc_id_3"])    # [!code highlight]
print(result)  # [{"code":0}, {"code":0}]
```

<Callout className="text-base" type="info">
  - When given a single `id`, `delete()` returns one `Status` object.
  - When given a list of `id`s, it returns a list of `Status` objects in the same order.
  - `{"code": 0}` indicates success.
  - Non-zero codes indicate failure — for example, if the document `id` does not exist.
</Callout>

## Delete by Filter Condition

Use `delete_by_filter()` to remove all documents that match a boolean `filter` expression.

The `filter` can reference scalar fields (e.g., `publish_year`, `language`) using comparison and logical operators.

```python title="Delete documents by filter condition"
# Delete all books published before 1900
collection.delete_by_filter(filter="publish_year < 1900")   # [!code highlight]

# Combined filter
collection.delete_by_filter(                                # [!code highlight]
    filter='publish_year < 1900 AND (language = "English" OR language = "Chinese")'
)
```
