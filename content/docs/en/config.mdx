Before performing any database operations, you can optionally configure global settings using the `init()` function.

- If omitted, Zvec automatically applies sensible defaults — typically tuned to your system's available memory, CPU, and environment.
- Use `init()` when you need to customize settings, such as
  - Adjusting log verbosity or output format
  - Controlling concurrency (e.g., query thread count)

<Callout className="text-base" type="info">
  Call `init()` once, and only at application startup — before any collections are created or opened. It is not intended for runtime reconfiguration.
</Callout>

## Configuration Example

```python title="Global configuration"
import zvec

# [!code word:init]
zvec.init(
    log_type=zvec.LogType.CONSOLE,
    log_level=zvec.LogLevel.WARN,
    query_threads=4,
)
```

- Logs messages to the **console** at `WARN` level or higher.
- Limits query execution to 4 threads.
