title: Flat Index
description: The Gold Standard for Exact Similarity Search
---


## How It Works

Performs an exact (brute-force) similarity search by comparing the query vector against every vector in the dataset.

## When to Use a Flat Index

- ✅ Small datasets
- ✅ Prototyping and experimentation
- ✅ Evaluation baselines
- ✅ Scenarios where 100% recall is non-negotiable

  **Best Practice**: Start with Flat Index during development and testing — it’s your reliability anchor. Once you validate your approach, consider approximate indexes (like [HNSW](../hnsw-index/)) for production-scale performance. Use the Flat index when working with tiny datasets where correctness outweighs speed.

## Advantages

1. ✨ **Perfect Recall Guarantee** — Finds true nearest neighbors
1. ✨ **Zero Configuration** — Simple setup with no tuning required
1. ✨ **Instant Indexing** — Build time is virtually immediate

## Limitations

⚠️ Search latency grows linearly with dataset size — making it impractical for large-scale workloads.
