**Zvec** is an open-source, fast, lightweight, and feature-rich vector database that runs entirely **in-process** — no server, daemon, or external infrastructure required. Just [install](./quickstart/#installation) the package and start indexing and querying vectors right away 🚀.

[Vector](./concepts/vector-embedding/) databases are commonly used to power AI applications like semantic search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), recommendation systems, and other similarity-based workflows.

Zvec can serve as a **standalone vector database** for end-to-end storage and search, or it can be **seamlessly integrated into existing search systems** (such as traditional SQL databases) as a dedicated vector search engine.

Built on **Proxima** — Alibaba Group's high-performance, production-grade vector search engine — Zvec delivers **low-latency**, **scalable**, and **battle-tested** similarity search. With its minimal-dependency, in-process design, Zvec is well-suited for virtually any scenario:

- 💻 From **rapid prototyping** and **local development**
- 📱 To **embedded applications** and **edge deployments**
- 🌐 All the way to **billion-scale, production-grade systems**

## Key Features

- ⚡ **Blazing Fast**: Scale to billions of vectors with sub-millisecond search latency.
- 🧩 **Simple, Just Works**: A single package is all you need — install it and start searching in seconds. No servers, no config, no fuss.
- ✨ **Dense + Sparse Vectors**: Work with both dense and sparse embeddings, with native support for multi-vector queries in a single call.
- 🎯 **Hybrid Search**: Combine semantic similarity with structured filters for precise results.
- 📦 **Runs Anywhere**: As an in-process library, Zvec runs wherever your code runs — notebooks, servers, CLI tools, or even edge devices.
