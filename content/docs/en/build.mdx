If you'd like to build **Zvec** from source, you can clone the repository and install it locally.

## Install from Source

<Callout className="text-base" type="info">
    The repository uses **Git submodules**. Cloning may take a few minutes depending on your network speed.
</Callout>

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/alibaba/zvec.git
cd zvec

# Install from source
pip install .
```

## Build Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- **Supported platforms**: Linux (ARM64/x86_64) or macOS (ARM64/x86_64)
- C++17 compatible compiler
- **scikit-build** (installed automatically as a build dependency, but may require manual configuration in some environments)
  <Callout className="text-base" type="idea">

    **Troubleshooting Tips**:

  - If you encounter issues during the build process, try setting a custom build directory for **scikit-build**.  
    This can help avoid cache inconsistencies and makes it easier to inspect detailed build logs:

    ```bash
    export SKBUILD_BUILD_DIR=/tmp/build  # Or other directory
    pip install .
    ```

    After the build attempt, you can examine the contents of **/tmp/build** (or your chosen directory) to review compiler output and diagnose errors.

  - By default, **scikit-build** uses **Ninja** as the build system. To use **Unix Makefiles** instead, set:

    ```bash
    export CMAKE_GENERATOR="Unix Makefiles"
    pip install .
    ```

    **Known Issue: AMD Platform Build Crash**

    > A recent community report has identified a build crash occurring on certain AMD platforms.
    >
    > Our team is actively working on a permanent fix. In the meantime, please use the following workaround to successfully build the project from source.

    You need to explicitly set the build flag in the build configuration.

    1. Open the **pyproject.toml** file located in the root directory of the project.
    1. Locate the `[tool.scikit-build.cmake.define]` section.
    1. Add the following line:
      ```toml
      ENABLE_BROADWELL = "ON"      ### Enable Broadwell Microarch
      ```
