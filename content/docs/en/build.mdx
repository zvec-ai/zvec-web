If you'd like to build **Zvec** from source, you can clone the repository and install it locally.

## Install from Source

<Callout className="text-base" type="info">
    The repository uses **Git submodules**. Cloning may take a few minutes depending on your network speed.
</Callout>

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/alibaba/zvec.git
cd zvec

# Install from source
pip install .
```

## Build Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- **Supported platforms**: Linux (ARM64/x86_64) or macOS (ARM64/x86_64)
- C++17 compatible compiler
- **scikit-build** (installed automatically as a build dependency, but may require manual configuration in some environments)
  <Callout className="text-base" type="idea">

    **Troubleshooting Tips**:

  - If you encounter issues during the build process, try setting a custom build directory for **scikit-build**.  
    This can help avoid cache inconsistencies and makes it easier to inspect detailed build logs:

    ```bash
    export SKBUILD_BUILD_DIR=/tmp/build  # Or other directory
    pip install .
    ```

    After the build attempt, you can examine the contents of **/tmp/build** (or your chosen directory) to review compiler output and diagnose errors.

  - By default, **scikit-build** uses **Ninja** as the build system. To use **Unix Makefiles** instead, set:

    ```bash
    export CMAKE_GENERATOR="Unix Makefiles"
    pip install .
    ```

  </Callout>
