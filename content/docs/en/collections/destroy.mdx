Destroying a collection **permanently deletes it from disk**. This operation **cannot be undone**.

<Callout className="text-base" type="warn">
  **Warning**: All data in the collection will be lost. Ensure you no longer need the collection or have created a backup before calling `destroy()`.
</Callout>

```python title="Destroy a collection"
import zvec

collection = zvec.open(path="/path/to/my/collection")

# Permanently delete the collection
collection.destroy()  # [!code highlight]
```

After calling `destroy()`, the collection directory and its contents are removed from the filesystem.

Do not use the `collection` object afterward — it is no longer valid.
