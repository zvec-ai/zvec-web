import { Accordion, Accordions } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/accordion';

Once you've opened a collection, you can inspect its structure, configuration, and runtime state to better understand how it's organized and performing. This is especially helpful during development, debugging, or system monitoring.

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Code Example">

  ```python title="Open a collection"
  import zvec

  # [!code word:collection]
  collection = zvec.open(path="/your/specified/path/")

  print(collection.schema)  # View the schema [!code highlight]
  ```

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Quick Reference

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `Collection.schema` | Collection structure and field definitions (e.g., vector dimensions, data types) |
| `Collection.stats` | Runtime metrics such as document count and index completeness |
| `Collection.option` | Runtime settings (e.g., read-only mode, memory mapping) |
| `Collection.path` | Filesystem path to the collection directory |

## Collection Schema

To view the [schema](../create/#step-1-define-the-schema):

```python
print(collection.schema)
```

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Example">

  ```json
  // [!code word:fields]
  // [!code word:vectors]
  {
    "name": "my_collection",
    "fields": {
      "price": {
        "name": "price",
        "data_type": "INT32",
        "nullable": false,
        "index_param": {
          "enable_range_optimization": true
        }
      },
      "category": {
        "name": "category",
        "data_type": "ARRAY_STRING",
        "nullable": true,
        "index_param": {
          "enable_range_optimization": false
        }
      },
      "image_url": {
        "name": "image_url",
        "data_type": "STRING",
        "nullable": true,
        "index_param": null
      }
    },
    "vectors": {
      "image_vector": {
        "name": "image_vector",
        "data_type": "VECTOR_FP32",
        "dimension": 256,
        "index_param": {
          "type": "HNSW",
          "metric_type": "COSINE",
          "m": 100,
          "ef_construction": 500,
          "quantize_type": "UNDEFINED"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  1. `"name": "my_collection"`: The name of the collection.
  1. `"fields"`: A map of scalar field names to their definitions.
      <Callout className="text-base" type="info">
        If `index_param` is not null for a scalar field, that field has an [inverted index](../../concepts/inverted-index/).
      </Callout>
      - `"price"`: A required 32-bit integer, with inverted index and range query optimization enabled.
      - `"category"`: An optional array of strings with an inverted index enabled; range query optimization is disabled (not meaningful for array types).
      - `"image_url"`: An optional string, with no indexing applied.
  1. `"vectors"`: A map of vector names to their definitions.
      - `"image_vector"`: A 256-dimensional floating-point vector indexed with [HNSW](../../concepts/vector-index/hnsw-index/) using cosine similarity and no quantization.

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Collection Statistics

The `stats` property provides real-time operational insights:

```python
print(collection.stats)
```

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Example">

  ```json
  {"doc_count":100, "index_completeness":{"image_vector":1.000000}}
  ```

  1. `doc_count`: Total number of documents currently stored.
  1. `index_completeness`: Fraction (0.0~1.0) indicating how much of the vector data has been indexed. A value of 1.0 means indexing is complete.

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

---

## Collection Options

Runtime behavior is governed by the options used when opening the collection:

```python
print(collection.option)
```

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Example">

  ```json
  {"enable_mmap":1, "read_only":0}
  ```

  1. `enable_mmap: 1` → Memory-mapped I/O is enabled for faster access.
  1. `read_only: 0` → The collection is open for both reads and writes.

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

---

## Collection Path

The `path` property returns the on-disk location of the collection:

```python
print(collection.path)
```

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Example">

  ```text
  ./my_collection/
  ```

  This is the same path passed to `db.open()`. It's useful for logging, backup scripts, or diagnostics.

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
